        Professor Unit 1(extension): This week is still on new writing getting
        my point across also I read that APA can be Calibri 11 font can I do
        this? It would just help not cutting out as much I can get attached to
        my writing. But I added stuff on decision support systems, how they
        work, and how such systems would work in medical applications. Be it
        implants, for doctors or both. blue will be removed green is
        questionable content haven’t decide if it stays or goes. Orange is
        section that made need to be moved. Bold notes for myself. Brown is new
        source material/writing I think writing wise besides making a better
        conclusion this will be as far as I go for the thesis There is one
        excerpts from a source I did yet summarize I decided to cut it for the
        thesis but find space in the book. My first priority moving forward is
        cut down the length for thesis requirement, do another edit and add
        section headings, do the TOC, and then I think I am done for the
        thesis!!!!! * Side note- The references are where they are so that as I
        am editing I can easily check back with the source because sources
        information is under the section the uses the sources also the paper is
        still single spaced because it makes it easier for the editing process
        final copy will have full APA considerations. Can Man be Machine Humans
        have been interacting with machines for over a century now. Where did it
        begin? For some it is easy to work their way backwards and remember some
        of this history. How did a mechanized world debating its future on the
        eve of climate change destruction come from a world where the humans the
        machines that they use at one point did not exist? Does the world begin
        and end with our existence in it.? Can we move forward and create an us
        in the now without machines? What does it mean to be us, to be human and
        why are we so unique? Can we make ourselves better or control what we
        become? Are these questions forever part of the conglomerate of the
        unknown? No, who we are as human beings is fluid, the further
        integration with machines who we could be would be better for us as
        humans and for the earth we call our home. What does it mean to be
        human? Is it our biology, our psychology or something else entirely? I
        often asked my self this question, what does it mean to be human or what
        makes me in particular a human being. Not saying I would describe myself
        as anything but human. More so I have a hard time finding a definition
        that differs than say a monkey or goldfish at the same time. From a
        scientific perspective what characteristic or element of humanity is
        expressed differently from other natural organisms. I mean what it means
        to be us to ourselves has changed and at one point what are we now. How
        would one accurately examine the phenomenon that is the human existence.
        One way would be to bring to light the elements that make up the average
        human body. Below is and excerpt describing the make up of the human
        body Human composition surface overview Excluding trace elements there
        are about 20 elements that make up the human body. There rough
        percentages of these elements in the body based on a “normal” diet.
        Oxygen makes up the largest percentage at 65%, there is Hydrogen that
        makes up 10%. A large part of these two elements combine to form the
        molecule H20 or water which alone accounts for 60% of the body mass ​
        (Schirber, 2019)​. Just like the earth a majority of our make up is
        water. Humans, with all our cells and bacteria are really just an opaque
        manifestation of our planet. On one level one could see an organism made
        up of mostly water with countless amounts of smaller organisms
        inhabiting all through out. There are different processes that are
        happening inside and on the surface. That description could apply to
        both humans and our planet earth. Return to our discussion on the
        elemental make up of our human bodies, the element that makes up the
        next largest percentage is Carbon at 18%. Too much will kill you but
        without we could not survive, same with our planet. I’m sure any adult
        alive during 2015+ will can speak the truth to this with the climate
        crisis guiding a large portion of macro political and financial
        discussions. Next on the human body elemental list is nitrogen which
        makes up 3%, Calcium which makes up 1.5% and Phosphorus which makes up
        1%. The rest the elements found in the average human body make up a
        fraction of a percentage of the human body’s composition. Potassium and
        Sulfur both make up 0.25% individually. Sodium and Chlorine respectively
        make up 0.15%. Magnesium makes up 0.05%, Iron makes up 0.006%, Fluorine
        0.0037%, Zinc 0.0032%, Copper 0.0001%, Iodine 0.000016%, Selenium
        0.000019%, Chromium 0.0000024%, Manganese 0.000017%, Molybdenum
        0.000013% and Cobalt at 0.0000021% ​ (Schirber, 2019)​. Some may be
        particularly surprised to find sulfur and phosphorus among the list as
        these are toxic chemicals and in small dosages can be fatal, but those
        elements are outlined as being in the human body. Now we have mapped the
        elements but there are other chemicals and molecules that are also found
        in the human body not outlined in the elemental list. Never the less,
        just think when one looks at their fellow man, they are actually looking
        at some form of composition of these percentages of elements. Each of
        these elements play a role or aide in both micro and macro level
        functions to sustain the body the same way a human’s organs in
        conjunction with skeletal muscular system work together to keep the body
        in form of stasis. Very similar to the way different natural
        environmental events like volcanos eruptions, storm systems, and living
        organism work together to recycle resources across the face and interior
        mantle of the planet. ​ (Schirber, 2019)​. Schirber, M. (16, April 2019)

        https://www.livescience.com/3505-chemistry-life-human-body.html (Carbon)
        Carbon is a particularly special element. In our bodies carbon is an
        energy burning biproduct and helps the body build complex molecules. On
        our earth carbon helps regulate the climate. Carbon is in you in. It is
        in everything living thing you see. It is in our oceans and our skies.
        Children are taught at a very young age in grade school that all humans
        inhale oxygen and exhale carbon. That is just one of the many processes
        that make up the carbon cycle. The carbon cycle is how miniscule atoms
        of carbon and nitrogen flow through living organisms and our
        environment. Carbon that is in the air gets absorbed by the ocean. Once
        there it gets used by plankton that are floating on the surface for
        their photosynthesis processes. Those plankton get eaten by larger and
        larger organisms. When the organisms dies, the left over carbon get
        released back into the atmosphere and into the soil. At the same time on
        land plants absorb carbon for their photosynthesis process like the
        plankton and also get eaten by larger and larger organisms. When plants
        die their left-over carbon also gets released into the atmosphere and
        the soil. Some of that carbon in the ocean and on land gets ingrained
        into the rock on the earths surfaces and builds up in fossil fuels like
        coal and oil. When human use and burn these resources they become apart
        of the larger carbon cycle (“The Carbon Cycle”, n.d.) The Carbon Cycle.
        (n.d.) Retrieved from: https://scied.ucar.edu/carbon-cycle Just think
        the carbon that humans are exhaling right now was once inside of
        countless other organisms past and present. Carbon is a part of the
        human body that is essential to human survival and is recycled through
        everything on this planet. One crazy thing to thing about is that humans
        alive today are probably breathing dead dinosaur carbon right now. You
        are intaking carbon from every person you interact with. It is a part of
        us that is the same across the board and bridges the gap between all
        things. (Return to element break down ) Return to the functions of the
        elements in the human body, calcium is an element that holds one of the
        larger elemental percentages in the human body. It aides in muscle
        contractions and protein regulations not to mention comprising large
        portions our skeleton and dental structures (Schirber, 2019). Imagine
        trying to eat something with out teeth. That would be the human reality
        without calcium. In retrospect there are so many other organisms and
        humans (false teeth) that function just find without teeth. However,
        most humans would not be jumping for joy at that reality. Potassium
        helps the body’s nerves to have electrical signals as well as help
        regulate the body’s heartbeat. Sodium is another electrically charged
        element that also facilitates the nervous system electrical charges and
        helps the body retain water. Without sodium the human’s body would have
        issues keeping what makes up 60 percent of the mass of their bodies. The
        sulfur in the body allows for the many proteins to be able to hold their
        shape. Chlorine also known chloride balances the fluid levels in the
        body. Magnesium aides in the function of approximately 300 different
        metabolic responses. Iron carries oxygen inside red blood cells
        throughout the body and also is a key element in the metabolism process.
        Fluorine is also found bones and teeth with calcium and helps prevent
        teeth decay. Zinc plays a role in regulating genes. There have been some
        connections made between Zinc deficiencies in the body and the dwarfism
        condition in humans. Copper is what helps facilitates the role iron
        needs to play in the body. Iodine is used to make the thyroid hormones.
        Selenium and Manganese play important role with different enzymes.
        Manganese being important to enzymes specific to mitochondria. Chromium
        helps regulate sugar. Molybdenum helps transform nitrogen and sulfur
        into useable states. Cobalt makes up the portion of b12 that helps DNA
        regulation and protein formations (Schirber, 2019). For the sake of a
        thought experiment, imagine all of these elements and their average
        human body percentages in clear containers side by side in a room. Enter
        that room and what would you see? Would you see a human being in those
        containers? If one never read the previous paragraph and came upon this
        room, would they even see a potential human being? Would the average
        allow these elements in a room to represent what is means to be human,
        what it means to be themselves as a person. Thinking back to the carbon
        excerpt, does this cycling in some way or form not apply to all of the
        elements on our planet. Have there not been a consistent amount of
        materials on this planet minus the occasional deposit from an asteroid?
        It would seem that organisms live on the surface of the earth in general
        are just rearrangements of recycled elements building us humans up while
        keeping us alive at the same time. I am no closer to answer the age-old
        question of what it means to be human the next person or previous
        average person. However, when I read the elemental makeup of the average
        human body I think does it even matter? How much more different if we
        changed a few things, what would we get? Now obviously some of these
        elements are biproducts of other elements. There also would be a big
        difference between changing the elemental makeup during development
        versus after full growth is achieved. Even then the potential
        differences would be drastically different during early stages of
        development versus later. What does our past say about us? Does it say
        anything at all? Can what it means to be human be describe by human DNA?
        According to Lee and Ramsey, the human body has 3 billion building
        blocks also know as DNA that dictate the genetic expression of human
        beings. All human beings have 99.9% of their respective DNA in common
        with the human next to them. Think about 175 books that have a total of
        262,000 pages to represent the totality of the human DNA. If each human
        being was composed of books instead of DNA pair with that same number of
        pages, there would only be about 500 of those pages that would differ
        from person to person making them an individual. So, on a macro level we
        basically all have the same DNA (Lee and Ramsey, 2018). But what does
        DNA do? DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic acid and is literally a molecule
        the gives a cell instructions on how to function and what to produce.
        DNA is found in two places inside a cell the main nucleus of the cell
        and there many sets of DNA in one cell. The DNA groups are packed in
        what is call a chromosome. During different cell processes, DNA gets
        traversed and read to create proteins, initiate biological processes,
        and/or transfer to another cell during cell division. There also is DNA
        inside a cell’s mitochondria which is where cells get there energy to
        function properly. More specifically, mitochondria are organelles that
        are membrane bound. The energy these organelles produce is chemical.
        Once the energy is produced it gets stored in a adenosine triphosphate
        (also known as APT) molecule. The mitochondria DNA in a cell is passed
        on only from mother to child. On the flip side, the nucleus DNA is split
        equally between the father and the mother and passed on the to child
        (NIH, n.d.). Take a moment to recognized how much the female DNA
        permeates into our species. DNA itself is a collection of phosphates,
        sugars, and nitrogen bases that are linked together to form a DNA chain.
        As stated earlier DNA, creates proteins. A gene is actually a particular
        type of protein made by DNA. Genes actually are a very small part of DNA
        making up one percent (NIH, n.d.). So, this incredibly small complex
        molecule called DNA contains instructions for all living organisms and
        humans share almost 100% of the same DNA with each other. Although that
        .01% makes a huge difference on a micro level in the expression of our
        species it is still very small percentage of anything for that matter.
        However that is not to say that .01% or 500 pages of our respective
        books is not complex. It dictate things like hair color, eye color,
        prominent diseases, prove presence at a crime, determine a familiar
        link, the list goes on. The interesting thing is that with race, there
        is no gene found that can determine a person’s race. Also consider this,
        we may have 99.9% of the same DNA as the other humans but we also share
        96% of that same DNA with chimpanzees as well. We also chare 90% of the
        same genes with the domesticated cats, 80% of the same genes with
        domesticated cattle and humans also share 60% of their DNA with the
        average banana(Lee and Ramsey, 2018). (Samantha Lee and LydiaRamsey,
        2018). Humans share almost all of our DNA with cats, cattle and mice.

        Would one consider DNA a relevant explanation of what it means to be
        human? On a technical level one could say it is pretty close. I
        personally find it perplexing how such a small variance translate to
        such cumbersome number of large differences and seemingly infinite ones.
        It reminds me of rifle training in the military and how a slight
        distance in direction can lead to feet or even meters the further you go
        down range. Another thought process is Army land navigation how being
        off be degree when shooting an azimuth with your compass you could end
        up over a thousand meters away from your target. Our DNA is so close,
        that it is reasonable to assume that it could serve as a good example.
        However, we must also consider that we are so close genetically to some
        other animals that on a metaphorical level, with a few minor changes DNA
        and humans can become their animal counter parts. Thinking of DNA of as
        simply instructions, can shed light on how connected humans actually
        are. Thinking of a chimpanzee, one of our closer genetic relatives, let
        do another thought experiment. Try to envision ourselves actually have
        the ability to create the instructions to create one human and one chimp
        side by side. We would approach this simply by giving instructions the
        same way DNA does to a cell’s nucleus. Many would consider the heart to
        be one of the most important organs for any species. Many primitive
        cultures would regularly eat the hearts of their enemies. So, we will
        start here. For the chimp heart its primary function would be to pump
        blood so let’s give that instruction. The human’s heart would also need
        to have this primary function so it would also need to be given it that
        instruction. There would also need to be a left and right ventricle in
        both the human and the chimpanzee heart. Where things would start to
        varying is when things like the size, the blood types, and other common
        sense variances start to come into play. Then repeat that same process
        for the next organ and the next. Just simply to recreate the two side by
        side we would have to utilize a lot of the same instructions just as DNA
        does on our planet. Just think, if humans we able to change a few
        aspects of their DNA or the instructions that make humans, humans there
        is a good possibility that humans could simply be and have
        characteristics of something else. Say we introduced sulfur into the
        human body, 300% more than what is found in a normal adult human, into a
        human fetus…. Putting the obvious morbid nature of this scenario aside
        we could obviously conclude the fetus would not survive. Let’s say we
        repeated this experiment with an adult. What would happen? In a few
        cases we have embarked with these types of research with animals already
        to get some desirable traits and characteristics from one animal
        transferred to another. Humans have been experimented with genetics for
        years now. (Animal Hybrid Monologue) Take humans for example. They most
        likely would survive the event. I am making no new claim to medical
        expertise and no I did not really conduct this experiment. I present
        this as more of a thought experiment to highlight what view as the
        randomness of the elemental make up of the human body. What make us
        human, what makes our specific combination of elements different from
        say, another specific combination of elements other then it is a
        different combination. (Gene Editing) before crisper I before we dive
        into the results of gene mixing/editing, we should first discuss how it
        is done in the first place. Since the 1960s scientists have been
        conducting research to figure out how to edit various genomes or DNA.
        Originally, molecular widgets where taken from bacteria where then used
        to slice apart or re-attach together DNA bases. In 1972 Dr. Herbert
        Boyer PHD (assistant professor at the time) founded a company that found
        a way to easily slice and re-attach DNA. The company’s name was
        Genentech and their technique then was used to create hybrid sequences
        of mix matched genes. This became the basis of gene therapy or imbuing
        unhealthy cells with healthy genes to make up for the ones making the
        cell sick. For example, one could take HIV genes and delete them from
        the virus culture. Then go back and splice in a healthy gene. The
        culture could then be reintroduced into the body and it will then
        release copies of itself throughout the patient’s body and alleviate the
        symptoms. The practical gene therapy was first tried in 1989 but of
        course had many unforeseen setbacks (Bleicher, 2018). Bleicher, A. (23,
        October 2018) Genome Editing Before CRISPR: A Brief History Retrieved
        from:https://medium.com/ucsf-magazine/genome-editing-before-crispr-a-brief-history-f02c1e3e2344
        crisper Genome editing mostly recently has been completed by way of a
        newer technique called CRISPR. CRISPR allows for a faster, accurate and
        more efficient gene editing process then previous mainstream approaches.
        It also is a significantly cheaper process to fund. CRISPR was developed
        from watching genome editing happened naturally in bacteria and adapting
        the process to fit the needs of science. In the body bacteria will take
        a piece of viral DNA and add it to what is called the CRISPR array. When
        the body interacts with that virus again this time there will be RNA
        segments sent out from the CRISPR array to target the viral DNA, cut it
        apart, and disable the virus. In the lab scientist first create a piece
        of RNA with that is programed to bind to a specified sequence in a DNA
        genome. Now the DNA sequence of the virus can be recognized and cut with
        a Cas9 enzyme at a target location. Once the cut has been made scientist
        replace the segment with a customized DNA sequence. The main purpose of
        genome editing is to help prevent and treat human diseases. The work is
        done with cells and animal test subjects. There is more research needed
        to determine the safeness for human trails. Some of the areas gene
        editing shows the most promise is with the treatment of cancer, heart
        disease, mental illness, and HIV. One of the bigger barriers to human
        test subjects are some of the ethical considerations. That is why a lot
        of human cell usage for gene editing research is limited to cells that
        are not egg or sperm cells or somatic cells as these are the types of
        cells that cannot passed down the changes. Once question that comes up
        when considering using germline cells (sperm or egg cells) is if it is
        ethical to enhance one’s normal facets such as strength or intelligence.
        Questions like these and others have resulted in germline gene editing

        We have already made hybrid embryos crossing by adding human DNA to both
        sheep and pig embryos. However, the past in every country where this
        research has taken place, these embryos would not be allowed to fully
        develop. In June of 2019 Japan became the first country to allow human
        hybrid embryos to develop to term. According to Cassela (2019),
        University of Tokyo researcher named Hiromitsu Nakauchi has the hope of
        one day being able to provide relief to the hundred of thousands of
        waiting transplant patients. There are many fears of a humanized animal
        being developed. There currently a lack of control of what human stem
        become after they are inserted into an animal embryo. There are many
        safeguards put into place to stop the experiment if the human percent of

        (other hybrids) There are other animal hybrids that exist in the world
        today. Some more logical and close in genetic make up like the liger
        which is a mix between lion and tiger. A liger for a while was thought
        to be part of the imaginations of science fiction. However, today (as
        the Tiger King can tell you) they are very real and are the result of
        mating between a male lion and female tiger. Although the conception can
        happen naturally they are still consider a man-made animal as such
        breeding between species does would not naturally happen in the wild. It
        is considered geographically impossible as the lion species originates
        in Africa and the Tiger species originates in Asia. The health results
        of the paring are actually quite grim. They are prone to cancer, organ
        failure, giantism, not being sterile, and other
        deformities(Turpentinecreek, n.d.). Turpentinecreek(n.d.) Hybrid Species
        – Ligers and Tigons Retrieved from:
        https://www.turpentinecreek.org/hybrid-species-ligers-and-tigons/ Some
        of the other hybrids that exist today actually do sound like something
        out of a science fiction novel like the mix between the spider and the
        goat. This is a hybrid I find particularly fascinating. The hybrid is
        made by taking stem cells from a particular spider and inserting them
        into a goat embryo. The result is a silk protein being produced in the
        goat’s milk that can be processed out and then use for… silk stuff.
        Spider silk is sought after because it is particularly strong and
        elastic. The potential medical uses for spider silk are huge and
        numerous. It could be used for artificial ligaments and tendons, eye
        structures, or jaw repair just to name a few. The potential uses outside
        of medicine are even more numerous. It could be used to make a stronger
        lighter bullet proof vest, better airbags, or rope. This particular mix
        faired much better than the lion tiger hybrids. While being able to
        produce the spider’s silk protein the goats themselves experienced no
        health issues or differences. They maintained their appearance and
        behavior. The next step would be to try and repeat this process with a
        plant for mass production. As doing this with plants instead of animals
        would be a more ethical and better for the environment(Zyga, 2010).

        rather strange mix that produces a colorful effect is the glowing in the

        jellyfish’s genes the genome of a rabbit. This particular gene editing
        has also been done in the past to create glow in the dark monkeys and
        cats. In the light they look like a normal animal add a black light and
        they glow green. There are so many interesting genetically modified
        animal’s hybrids out there. There also was another genetically alter
        goat but instead of inputting a silk gene and was spliced in to make the
        goat naturally produce a common malaria vaccine in their milk that can
        be extracted (Rojahn, 2013) Rojahn, S. (14, August 2013)

        I bring these examples up to highlight my next point. How fluid is
        elemental and biological construction that there must be safeguards put
        in place to keep us from further integrating or creating new intelligent
        life. Take this researcher’s fall from fame to prison. Gene editing with
        the proper training and resources is not something out of reach for the
        average biomedical researcher. It is more of a matter of the
        restrictions stopping the amount of progress that can be made. There are
        legitimate ethical concerns against some levels of genetic research. An
        example of progress clashing with both restrictions and ethical
        considerations is He Jiankui, a man who’s research landed him with a 3
        year prison sentence. In 2018 Jiankui announced that he and two
        collaborators had successfully gene edited babies which is an illegal
        medical practice. The group was able to achieve this by forging research
        documents for ethical review and lying to doctors. They injected
        gene-edited embryos into two women. One of the women gave birth to twins
        and the other a single child. Jiankui also announced that the purpose of
        the research was possibly help children be born resistant to HIV. The
        embryo was modified specifically to be HIV resistant. The two women he
        used for the research both had husband who where currently diagnosed
        with HIV but the women themselves where not. His main goal was to stop
        babies from being able to contract HIV. His goal was driven by HIV
        outbreaks on the African continent and the discrimination that these
        people face(Normile, 2019). However, his work was not received with
        positivity. A ruling stated that national biomedical research
        regulations as well many ethical considerations where deliberately and
        with regard for human life violated. Remember earlier it was discussed
        that gene editing and human it restricted from being used with
        reproduction medicine. That is precisely what happened in this case. The
        three researchers pleaded guilty. They were fined and sentenced to an
        average of two years in prison. Many in the scientific community viewed
        the risk far greater than the potential reward and, in their minds,
        negated any justification for the research or the way it was handled.
        Many also feel that this event will be a negative reputation for Gene
        editing in the foreseeable future. This event highlights a very valid
        point made earlier in this text, “who we are as human beings is fluid,”
        and ethical considerations are the only safeguards that keep humans from
        creating new lifeforms(Normile, 2019). Normile, D. (30, December 2019)

        Furthermore, two organisms originally thought genetically incompatible
        for example, an insect <-(find better word)an mammal (like in the goat
        and spider mix) can be combined to extract a certain animal’s byproduct
        in larger quantities. I think the biggest misconception is the perceived
        extent of the differences between us and the rest of the animal kingdom.
        Yes, there are complex differences that on a micro level express
        exponential levels of variance. However, on a macro level, those
        differences are actually minute. But hey I not advocating for or against
        human hybrids, and don’t do not think a majority of humans would
        necessarily agree to mix their DNA with that of an animal. I will say it
        is more common then one would think. I for one had to receive numerous
        bone grafts made from cow bones to help my bone structure heal from an
        injury. I do think the evidence begs the question if the norms we faced
        today are simply coincidental and reality is in general much more fluid.
        I think with animal hybrids it becomes even harder to specify what it
        means to be human and it makes sense many have questions. There are
        large populations that would be abrasive to the idea of putting animal
        matter in their body. But if one would say no to a hybrid heart to save
        your life what about a pacemaker or a cochlear implant? The technology
        of the cochlear implant is another interesting side topic that is talked
        more about in a later chapter. Back on the current topic, we have
        technically already begun the creation of new species based on gene
        editing. The results have been huge milestones for science while some
        have created new opportunities that can aid in human societies. Remember
        the spider goat, the traditional way of farming silk was by means of
        silkworms. The spider goat hybrid integrated on a wide scale or using a
        similar process with plants could significantly increase the over all
        yield potential. Using parts from other species may turn many off
        initially, but it is a fact that research is being done now to make
        hybrids that can grow organs that can be used for transplants.
        Regardless of the means, such additions are undertaken to utilize the
        shared benefits of the originally separate parts. But modern society has
        been addicted to adding things to themselves for almost as long as we
        have existed. The first prosthetics were made of wood and today
        countless human undertake procedures such as plastic surgery. Think back
        to the first uses of tools or the use of materials to serve as jewelry
        and compliment the outward appearance. The use of fragrances to make one
        more appealing to their own or another senses. I wonder if this
        characteristic could be one that could begin to define what it is to be
        a human. Common philosophies of human existence How would you describe
        you, what does it mean to be human/you? Many philosophers have tackled
        this question; Socrates, Plato, Nietzsche and Aristotle are just some of
        the few who have taken a stab at framing the human existence and the
        point there of. Find these philosophical works In the vast history of
        this planet humans have populated it for the minority of its existence.
        I personally find the idea of humans no longer existing on this planet a
        nightmare. However, one can not deny that for tens of millions of years
        this was the case and the earth was still populated by biological
        organisms. It would be hubris to believe the earth could not again exist
        without our species or any of the current species existing on this
        planet. In fact, logic would assume that one day there would be a new
        array of species based on the new climate stabilization like it has
        happen many times before. This true for wooly mammoth species in
        particular. If we were able to recreate them would they be able live
        today? Our earth has continuously been the platform of life creation
        based on the elements on the planet and the contrast of environments
        that exist on said planet. We are breathing the gases and comprised of
        past species and future species too would breath the gases we are today.
        The elements of this planet are continuously recycling and rearranging
        the elements of the planet into living organisms. I ask again what does
        it mean to be human? Karl Marx once said history is the continuous
        transformation of human nature. Friedrich Nietzsche described human
        existence as the intervals and intermissions in the symphony of life.
        Plato viewed human nature as originating from a soul.
        (https://ideapod.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-human-famous-philosophers-answer/)
        Are we not connected to the species of the past and the future? How
        would adding or taking away from ourselves be so different than what has
        already happen naturally on this planet? Will continue to happen rather
        we are here are not, rather we are apart of the process or not. The only
        thing certain is continuous change. Consider a quote by Thomas Aquinas,”
        We can’t have full knowledge all at once. We must start by believing;
        then afterwards we may be led on to master the evidence for ourselves.”
        I hope that after reading this book will help many believe in the a
        future where further integration is possible and not an object of SciFi
        so that we can master this concept and slowly make it an reality. I
        believe if we want to solidify our existence in a time of climate
        turmoil, we must be an active participant in this change. This can only
        be made possible in my opinion by becoming one with machines. First
        documented machine Some of the first machines came in the form of levers
        and the fulcrum. Archimedes (287-212 b.c.) was an influencer (but did
        not invent) in the development of the winch, pulley, lever, wedge and
        screw. He often is referred to as the founder of experimental science.
        The lever and fulcrum, according Judson Knight would be the equivalent
        of a crowbar balanced on a wood block (Knight 2001). However, coupled
        with an understanding of mathematics and physics it becomes a simple
        machine and for the time period an in valuable tool. From levers came
        pumps powered by levers. Pumps bred new pumps like the screw pump which
        breeds and understanding of fluid mechanics. With the understanding came
        about the pulley. With pulleys come cranes and with times of war
        catapults(Knight 2001). "Archimedes and the Simple Machines That Moved

        Finish timeline/connect better to rest of paper (may be for book not
        thesis) (Bad flow there are two separate points with no connection here)
        Here is where I think attention is warranted. The usage of machines for
        war purposes is where the true connection and widespread appreciation of
        machines was first developed. In the earlier 1500s Cesare Borgia
        employed Leonardo Da Vinci to pioneer many offensive and defensive
        mechanical weapons. Some of the more famous ones where the machine gun
        and many of his impenetrable fortresses. Da Vinci became the favorite
        designers for the war machines of many Italian war lords (“Leonardo da
        Vinci’s War Machines and Inventions for War”, n.d.). Fast forward
        centuries to the 1960s to when an extension of the U.S. military ARPA,
        developed ARPANET which later became the basis for all internet. Imagine
        society’s ability to post on social media or connect to a web server in
        a Starbucks café was motivated by war, wartime needs, and was brought to
        you by the U.S. military. This brings me to believe that one event that
        could spur an increase in innovation is war or the fear of war. Either
        for the whims of war or the future of industry, machines have furthered
        our understanding and manipulation of the world around us. That
        understanding brought more machines forming a cycle of development and
        innovation. Leonardo da Vinci’s War Machines and Inventions for War

        monologue) A mechanical invention that revolutionized society was the
        watch or rather the mechanical clock which later led to the production
        of personal clock also known as the watch. According to mainstream
        history, the first clock was invented in England in 1275. Although first
        clock functioned quite differently. It struck on the hour and there was
        no face. Later in the 16th century the use of brass bronze and silver in
        the construction became prevalent. In the 1540s made many jewelers began
        pick up the art of watch making producing the first ever pocket watch.
        Although it was not until 1680 that watches were made to track minutes.
        It is rumor that after King Charles 2nd introduced waistcoats is when
        pocket then watches became more mainstream. They were not made in mass
        production until later in the 19th century. Wrist watches made a big
        appearance in the first World War because soldiers needed to keep their
        hands free to tell time. It is funny because as a former infantry man I
        also wear a watch and I keep it on my left wrist with the face-oriented
        palm up. This way while I’m aiming down the sights with my rifle and my
        left hand is supporting my heat guard, I can look forward and see my
        sights and the time. Back to the watch, in 1930 the stop watch was
        patented although invented centuries earlier. Then 20 years later came
        electric watches that used a metallic core to produce a magnetic field
        when a current was passed through. Later came the battery power quartz
        watches. Fast forward to toady where the Samsung and Apple watches are
        one of the hottest wearable commodities(Smith, n.d.). Smith, E. (n.d.)

        with modern society. With it, people in society have been able to make
        more connections with each other and create complex connected computer
        networks. Society has become reliant on the information stored on these
        networks. The number of devices used has increased and the networks that
        connect them have increased in size as well. On the flip side there also
        has been an increase in the scale and frequencies of cyber-attacks. This
        increase has created a need for more efficient security solutions to
        protect computer networks. Intrusion detection has been proposed by many

        Make a better connection According to Jennifer Keating and Illah
        Nourbakhsh (2018), the current societal climate towards the advancement
        of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is mixed with anxiety and ambition.
        Keating believes some of the anxieties come not from the technical
        complexity of the technology but the ethics surround the usage of the
        technology and its possible threat to our existence. She ask, “ is
        rhetorical slippage betraying age-old philosophical questions on what it
        really means to be human? To what degree do our shortcomings in
        acknowledging human dignity in all populations (regardless of skin
        pigmentation, linguistic system spoken, geographical location, or
        socioeconomic position) emerge in questions pertaining to power dynamics
        between humans and machines” (para. 2)? Keating, J. & Nourbakhsh, I.
        (2018, February) Teaching Artificial Intelligence and Humanity:
        Communications of the ACM, Vol. 61 No. 2, Pages 29-32 This is a valid
        point, who are we as humans? From outside looking in what would human
        history history in its entirety say about us as people. Has there been
        any cultural history without internal and external conflicts,
        atrocities, or transgressions in their respective communities? Would we
        innovate the greatest feats only to follow them with greater tragedies?
        The original internet was the thought baby of a nation state in the time
        of war. After the discovery nuclear energy how much longer was the
        accident of Chernobyl or the development of the atomic bomb? How would
        humans navigate the ethics of how we use this technology to interact
        with each other? One example could be social medial. Take Facebook, 13
        years after its first year the platform grew from one million users to
        about one billion users in 2018. How much has the public opinion of the
        company evolved with its growth? On one side you have it been used as a
        hiring tool and the United States requires the analyzation of social
        media profiles for some non-native travelers. At the other end there is
        the Brexit event in the UK, the company’s role in U.S. 2016 election
        interference campaign, and the 2019 U.S. conservative political climate
        souring on coverage and censorship. Given the companies foundation is in
        western countries they current at odds with it. It could be assumed the
        company’s best days are behind them. Is A.I. doomed to follow suit? Or
        would it fix the problems of our humanity as well as lend its self as
        the most power tool of this planet’s history? Would it change are
        perceptions of the priorities of life? Another consideration is the
        ethics of coexistence as non-integrated humans and integrated humans
        would have to coexist. Regardless of the negative implications should
        humans not press forward? Consider the millennial generation. Themselves
        their children and their grandchildren would live through the current
        predictions of climatic destructions. In 2019 Elon Musk, as he had many
        times before predicted a mass dying event around the corner. Is not the
        climate behaving in unusual ways? Are humans not bound to this ship,
        this cycle? Is our demise our only hope for salvation? However, on the
        flip side what problem have humans not solved with some form of
        technology? Have humans not be able to create things capable of things
        that humans themselves are not? Are not things such as drones and other
        virtual devices already in use as an extension of the human senses?
        There are a number of machines and technologies that already, in their
        own way, are designed for direct biomedical integration. One would be
        remised to only look at the glass as half empty, or even half full, and
        not just simply see a glass with a specific amount of water in it.
        Following that metaphor, there have always been seen and unseen pros and
        cons that came with all technological innovations. Imagine that if Carl
        Benz or Henry Ford could look into the future and see the total number
        of deaths from their inventions in accidents every year and decided that
        automobile should remained a figment of their imagination and not become
        the standard for modernized day to day transportation? Were the Wright
        brothers wrong to invent the first airplane if they could see the number
        of people who died in future plane crashes? Should software not have
        ever been integrated with flying technology if one could have known of
        the Boeing 737 crash ahead of time? Should the internet not have been
        created in order to protect the world’s consumers from future
        cyber-crimes? Theres a quote by Benjamin Franklin to the effect of, “One
        who trades freedom for security will have never freedom or security”.
        Consider cyber security, on one level there is no such thing as an
        impenetrable network or un hackable algorithm. With this knowledge
        should we end all usage of information networks? One of the most popular
        security programs of 2018 is called PGP for pretty good security. There
        will always be a tug and pull between pros and cons of every situation.
        The goal should not to be avoidance but management. This way the risk
        can be minimized if not completely avoided, and the gains can be
        maximized. Technology has long had a history of delivering a longer list
        of benefits and success stories then their worst case scenario
        counterparts. Bad flow need connection (Start with artificial joints)
        (cochlear implant monologue will go here). When discussing human
        computer/machine integration, cochlear implants is especially relevant.
        It can be sad that in essence there already are bionic humans who use a
        directly interfaced technology to enhance or produce a sensory or
        capability that is currently damage or underdeveloped. The cochlear
        implant works through a network of electronical devices. The first piece
        being the actual implant which consist of a microphone for sound inputs,
        a speech processor, a transmitter to turn the speech into electrical
        signals, and electrode arrays that take speech inputs and turned them
        into electrical signals. Those signals get sent as impulses to the
        auditory nerve. The device takes sound directly to the auditory nerve in
        the form of those electrical signals(“Cochlear Implants”, n.d). When a
        person is hearing with a cochlear implant they are actually hearing in a
        different way then normal and not their normal method way of hearing
        being enhanced. The implants create signals by stimulating the auditory
        nerve and sending those signals directly to the brain. The technology
        the allows humans the ability to recreate the human sense of hearing
        already exist. The technology is uses to bring a hearing-impaired
        individual’s hearing up to the standard of normal hearing. What if this
        technology was taken many steps further and could be used to increase
        the hearing ability of non-impaired individuals as well? What if it were
        programed into the implant to pick up more frequencies then what we
        humans normally can pick up. “Cochlear Implants”( n.d). retrieved from:
        https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/cochlear-implants. Earlier chapter it
        was discussed that most humans at least in America are not jumping at
        the chance to integrate with an animal but are currently integrating
        with machines and information technology. What elements that are found
        in these machines are not found in some form of the human body
        naturally? Obviously, there are metals, plastics and other elements that
        are not found in the body. However, is not the human body just a
        collection of recycled parts? If genetics is so fundamentally fluid
        between humans and animals and the elements used are the same, why can
        humans not be fluid with machines? Why can machines not be created with
        the direct intentions of direct integration. Obviously, there are some
        capabilities that are bound by the limitations of progress and
        innovation. However, is society really so far away from this reality as
        some would exclaim? With out going into too much detail on the
        individual, my personal experience with cochlear implants was through a
        family member. The family had the procedure done at a young age to help
        their hearing. I remember as a child being fascinated by the technology.
        The family could attach a microphone to a person to hear that person
        directly in their head. They could even attach a smaller transmitter to
        an MP3 device and have music playing wireless directly in their head
        that no one else could see or hear. This was back in the late 90s and
        early 2000s. Imagine adding that ability to being able to hear a larger
        spectrum of sound frequencies a human can hear. If such advancements
        where made before the first smart phone would smart phones even exist?
        Consider the wide use of dogs to hear and alert of coming dangers. It is
        already common to use animals to aid us in areas where human’s natural
        senses fall sort. Would not using a machine over another biological
        lifeform to achieve our goals not be a more ethical choice? On one level
        we are experimenting with genetics and artificially adding genes from
        one species to another. The experiment itself and results are used for
        the overall benefit of the collective society. Would it not be more
        ethical to have machines fulfill the burdens we have placed on animals
        to fulfill? There currently is a limit to what a machine can create. On
        one level until humans can develop the food synthesizers depicted in the
        Fox’s television series the Orville, humans will still need to consumer
        animals among other things to sustain our own lives. However, that’s
        does not mean there are no ways to ethically minimize the number of
        things animals are used. I have long heard that another element of
        climate change is the number to animals that must exist to sustain our
        lives. (Stephen Hawking’s Chair) Before diving into the relevant
        technology to help build this point I would want to take the time to
        talk about the achievements of a man who while I may not have had to
        pleasure to meet personally, I have always viewed him as one of my
        heroes; Stephen Hawking. While working on his PhD he was diagnosed with
        amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is a motor neuron disease the takes
        away the body’s ability to voluntarily move their own muscles. He
        originally was given two years left to live. He worked through the
        disease continuing to strengthen his mind and intellect. His disease
        worked slower than average progression rate. That coupled with his
        marriage to his wife Jane and the family they made fueled his drive to
        make progress in the world of physics. He developed his own scientific
        visions and became immersed with the studies of the beginning of time
        and the study of thermodynamics. He dived deeper into inner workings of
        black holes and their event horizons. His greatest breakthrough was
        accomplished by trying to disprove an idea about entropy and black hole
        horizons that led to one of his greatest break throughs; black holes
        emit radiation. The equation that relates entropy to black holes was
        requested by him to be engraved on his tombstone. He made many more
        discoveries in physics and later in life published work; A brief history
        of Time. However, as his disease progressed more and more complicated
        machines had to be designed by technologist in order for him to
        communicate and continue his scientific research (Clark, 2018) Clark, S.

        ALS is a neuron disease that kills the muscles that control nerves in
        the body. The average person dies approximately five years from the
        onset of symptoms. In Hawking’s case the disease moved at a slower rate.
        As he continued to survived he also lost motor function at a slower
        rate. Even in his final days he maintained some mobility and control
        with some of the muscles of his face. The chair he operated allowed him
        to communicate and move around was controlled by a single switch on his
        Windows tablet PC. The PC used an EZ key interface that scanned keyboard
        letters, menu items, etc and waits a facial cheek movement to verify the
        connection. An algorithm developed by Intel scientist captured his
        writing style to predict words he would want to use next to streamline
        the experience (How it works team, 2016). How it works team. (1, August

        Just imagine if none of those technologies had found their way to Mr.
        Hawking. How far back would mankind’s understanding of the laws of
        physics and gravity be without his work. How would he have been able to
        share his genius with the world if it had not been for his indirect
        integration with hardware and software technologies? Imagine what more
        could he have been able to accomplish had there been more complex
        technology available. Remember, most people diagnosed with ALS do not
        fair half was well as Mr. Hawking did. Consider how many other geniuses
        or just average people with varying skills that could possibly have
        positive change in world but have their potential squashed by
        limitations outside of their control such as physical disabilities.
        Another person with similar hardships in life but was not influenced by
        technology is Hellen Keller. There was innovative interaction with a
        specific technology but the misfortunes she endured and how her life
        turned out in the end due to an innovative teacher is the highlight.
        Hellen Keller was born deaf and blind. Growing up she also could not
        speak because no one knew how to teach her. She was written off, thought
        to amount to nothing in life but a burden to her family. Then she met
        Anne Sullivan a person determined to leave her in a better condition
        than when she found her. Eventually, Hellen became the first deaf-blind
        person to earn a Bachelor of Art degree. She went from have no potential
        in the eyes of her peers on to make history and showing others how to
        open doors for other misfortunate. That has been the story of human
        computer/machine interaction and integration from day one.
        (Biography.com, 2020) Stephen Hawking is just an example of the depth of
        that truth. Humans can physically be unable to do most things but can do
        so much more through the use of technology.
        https://www.biography.com/activist/helen-keller (other movement
        complementary devices) Another similar but more complex innovation in
        the field of hardware dynamics when compared to the software dynamics of
        Hawking’s chair is the ReWalk system. The ReWalk system is a battery
        powered robotic exoskeleton that attaches to the legs and the lower
        back. There are motors located at the knee and hip joints that uses
        sensors to help the user adjust for foot falls. There are also forearm
        clutches for the user to hold to brace. Currently the system is being
        used for physical therapy and paralysis patients. The system is the
        first of its kind to be approved by the US FDA and it is also in use for
        qualifying veterans. Other equipment has followed however the expensive
        nature of the technology makes it a barrier for most patient’s
        insurance. This is the main reason less than 200 have been sold in the
        US.

        (Pacemaker Monologue here) Multiple family members of mine had a
        previous battle with congestive heart failure. Those experiences made me
        aware of another fascinating technology called a pacemaker. Similar to
        the cochlear implant technology as being also implanted under the skin
        is the pacemaker. This implant is a battery power device programed to
        send electrical signals to the heart. The signals are sent to the heart
        via wires called leads. The leads are directly connected to the heart
        and the generator. The wires first are inserted through an incision in a
        vein. Those wires are then fed through the incised vein directly into
        the heart. The purpose of the device is to detect irregular or slower
        heartbeats. Once such events are detected the device sends an electrical
        signal to the heart to get it once again beating at the correct pace.
        The device weighs about 28 grams and is composed of the generator and
        the electrical leads. The device is inserted under the skin on the left
        side of the chest below the collar bone. The leads go through the right
        atrium to the right ventricle. (“Heart pacemaker”, n.d.). A 100 years

        forward to today’s time period. Since 2015 the country of Sweden has had
        approximately 3,000 citizens have voluntarily implanted microchips under
        the skin into their hands. The first chips went in hands in Sweden in
        2015. The chip is small, comparable to a grain of rice. In Sweden the
        chip is used for various things like train tickets, identification codes
        and can also serve as a credit card. Sweden has historically been a
        culture more opened to sharing personal information. These chips in

        I will admit the whole microchip thing made me take a step back. The
        irony of this whole thing is a person who has degrees information
        technology and is writing on why mankind should further integrate with
        machines is also extremely paranoid. I would not be a first taker of
        this particular technology, but its existence leads premise to the
        topic. There are many Americans who would have negative thought
        processes or barriers towards having an electronic chip inserted into
        their body. However, the Apple watch in many ways could be seen as the
        wearable equivalent. How many people in America and the rest of the
        world use wearables to track things such as their steps, blood pressure,
        check and send messages, and use pay apps like Apple pay. The
        functionality of the microchip implant in one country is traded for a
        much bigger device with similar functions that can be removed at will.
        From that perspective many Americans are already living like the Swedes
        with small electronic devices being responsible for the collection and
        usage of some of the user’s most sensitive data. On an involuntary level
        in America there also is the ankle monitor technology used to track the
        location of individuals placed on house arrest. This is a technology
        most would avoid in America which could explain the barriers to
        microchip implants in the country. Spend more time breaking down house
        arrest technologyHowever, there are Americans exactly 80, who actually
        would and have chosen to inject a microchip in their bodies. For about a
        year, employees at a company called Three Square Market based in
        Wisconsin, have microchipped volunteers between the thumb and forefinger
        with an RFID like chip. The president of the company Patrick McMullan
        started the program after he took a chip to Sweden in 2017 and saw how
        they were microchipped. His chip is also about the size of a grain of
        rice and works like a passive RFID chip mean it has no internal power
        source(Metz, 2018). the specs of Three Square Market’s chip as it is
        proprietary technology but a look closer at RFID chips and how they work
        can be taken. (RFID chips info goes here) Radio Frequency Identification
        or RFID is actually a technology that has been around long before its
        implementation with microchips. Some examples of where these technology
        is already in use would include shopping mall’s anti-theft systems,
        logistics management, animal and patient tracking(we actually have had
        microchip implants for a long time just for a different purpose and a
        use no where near as wide spread), and prepaid cards. RFID chips are
        preferred against the more prevalent barcode strip systems due to its
        increase fault tolerance and limited restrictions on the user(Sheu,
        Tiao, Fan, &Huang, 2010). RFID systems are composed of an application
        system, reader, and a transponder. The system gets activated when the
        transponder and the reader come into close proximity. The reader sends
        the power needed for the RFID system to function in conjunction with the
        data. The RFID system has a circuit that collects and stores the energy
        from the reader and the uses that energy to power the other circuits.
        Once powered the transponder will then send the required preloaded data
        back to the reader. The reader then relays that information to the
        system’s internal application. Transponders also known as tags, carry a
        classification of being either passive or active. This is based on power
        provisioning. Passive transponders have no internal power and require
        their power from readers and magnetic field coupling. Active
        transponders carry and internal battery to power partial or complete
        functionality. RFID systems operate between125kHz long wave all the way
        to 5.8GHz microwave(Sheu, et al, 2010). SHEU, M., TIAO, Y., FAN, H., &

        to the vending machines in the building, gain access to office rooms,
        log on to computers, and make cafeteria purchases. They started by
        implanting 50 employee volunteers and since the program started 30 more
        have joined in the fun. The company is researching other ways the chip
        can be used(Metz, 2018). The microchip is just the beginning and there
        are even more fascinating technologies that compliment or directly
        interface with the human body. There is definitely more studying that
        needs to be done on the long term effects of the hand experiencing such
        a drastic increase in electromagnetic signals but on the surface the
        whole thing appears to be harmless, especially with passive RFID chips.

        RFID vs Sweden NFC (Artificial Joints) People all over the world have
        long been in need of some for of joint replacement due to injury or old
        age. I personally have two pins in my right shoulder. Joint replacements
        are a part of everyday life today. Humans have discovered building
        materials that will avoid immune responses. The materials varying to
        depending on the joint and joint function. Most often these are crafted
        from metals, metal alloys and plastics. Continue discussion (Artificial
        organs) In the field of bioengineering, research on artificial organs
        has been a need that has long been understood. Humans experience health
        issues that often time require an organ transplant for survival. The
        available organs never meet the demand especially when things like blood
        type come into play. The year 1982 saw the first fully functional
        artificial heart implanted into a human. It the implant was called the
        Jarvik-7. Created by Robert Jarvik and Willem Kolff, at the time it was
        considered a medical breakthrough. Kolff is also credit with creating
        the dialysis machine (which preforms the work of the body’s kidneys),
        the heart-lung machine and many blood transfusion procedures. Still with
        these advancements the average wait time for a kidney is about 3.6 years
        and it is estimated that over 100,000 are waiting for a kidney at any
        one time. The dialysis allows for longer wait periods but it is meant to
        function as a means to a hopefully sooner end. The status quo fuels the
        need for more research and innovation. There are two artificial heart
        technologies that have been developed in totality: BiVACOR and the
        SynCardia(ASME, 2017). The BiVACOR has a rotating hub with impellers
        mounted on the left and right sides and electromagnetic motor that is
        levitated and rotates the hub. The motor is connected to pump castings
        and pumps blood throughout the heart by way of differential fluid
        output. This device is reserved for patients facing end of life heart
        failure and are also not eligible for a heart transplant(Bivacor, n.d.).
        The McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine is currently working on
        an artificial liver by arranging stem cells on a 3-D scaffold. Another
        company Organovo has commercialized the 3-D printing of skin tissues.
        They have successfully printed liver, lung, heart, and kidney tissues.
        This innovation has been thought to be able to give robots a human
        touch. In 2017 two separate groups developed an artificial womb device.

        was to create a biological machine from the ground up. An evolutionary
        algorithm was used to determine possible new life form designs. The
        program was driven by basic biophysics of frog and cardiac cells. The
        more promising silico designs were used as templates. Stem cells where
        harvested from African frogs, separated into single cells, and left to
        incubate. Afterwards the cells were cut and joined to fit the silico
        designs very similar to the approach being researched for creating
        artificial livers. The frog skins cells provided an architecture while
        the cardiac tissue powered the movement needed specified by the computer
        doing the design process. Self-organizing patterns to allow the robots
        to move on their own. The xenobots are biodegradable and after seven
        days they are reduced to dead skin cells(University of Vermont, 2020).

        printing of organ and skin tissues could be integrated with robotics.
        Further proof that the fields of biomedical engineering, robotic
        engineering, and information technology should be merged or at least
        have more joint research projects. The xenobot researchers say their
        experiment has taught them a lot about how cells communicate and connect
        as well as furthered their understanding of computational science and
        the understanding of life. One big question in biology is the knowing
        and understanding algorithms or instructions that dictate life’s many
        forms and functions. Reflect back to the section on DNA, how it really
        is a combination of instructions on the cellular level and how
        understanding DNA is the key to understanding form and
        function(University of Vermont, 2020). It also begs to questions how

        net conversation) A innovative software based technology that has taken
        the world of information technology and his based on the functionality
        of the human brain, are neural nets. To put it simply neural nets are a
        set of algorithms that are modeled based on the human brain. The neural
        nets use sensory data to recognize patterns very similar to the way the
        brain used sensory inputs to facilitate movement and crucial bodily
        functions. The way neural nets achieve this is referred to as machine
        perception. This machine perception allows them to label or cluster the
        raw input of the sensory data. The patterns themselves are a
        representation of all real-world data and various data types. They also
        are numerical based and are organized into vectors. To make it even
        simpler, with neural networks, clustering and classifying large amounts
        data as it is being stored and managed. Un-labeled data can be
        classified based on similarities to other data. Neural networks are a
        big part of machine learning and deep learning applications. It is now
        also becoming a big part of predictive analytics. One example is being
        able to correlate the pixels in the image of a person to the actual
        person’s name. Very similar to the brain being able recognize certain
        facial features and attribute them to a person that brain “knows”. Some
        other examples where deep learning predictive analysis can be applied
        are medical issues like strokes and heart attacks, customer satisfaction
        based on metadata, and or hardware processes like manufacturing and
        transportation. Being able to predict helps to also prevent. The deep
        learning works by stacking neural networks on top of each other to form
        several layers. The layers are actually nodes. In software development
        nodes is simply a place where a computation happens, or data is store.
        In the brain it only a place of computation and in this case neural
        network mimics this approach instead of the traditional software
        development approach. In the human brain nodes are loosely patterned on
        neurons that are waiting on sufficient amounts of particular stimuli to
        fire. The node adds coefficients also known as weights to the data that
        in turn adds either positive or negative significance to the data based
        on the task the algorithm is attempting to learn. This limits the amount
        of error in the learning process. This process repeats and the weights
        get summed and passed to another node the decides how far the signals
        proceeds to the final outcome. This is one signal layer for deep
        learning, many of these layers get stack on top of each other

        (Neural transmitter) Another new breaking age technology that was made
        specifically with human integration in mind is Elon Musk’s Neural Link.
        The technology is the product of the technology startup company,
        Neurallink. The technology is made up of implants that use artificial
        intelligence to connect with a computer interface. The technology
        requires a neurosurgical robot that would implant flexible electrode
        threads into the human brain. The purpose is to detect/record the
        electrical signals of the human brain and transmit it to and external
        interface device. The information used would help further research or
        various brain and spine related issues. That research could then be used
        to provide innovative treatment. According to Hitti, Musk envisioned
        paralyzed patients being able to use this technology to find easier use
        or new use of limbs and be able to use technologies like phones and
        computers (2019). Remember Mr. Stephens Hawking, how would such a
        technology had benefitted him in his life and other like him? Musk also
        envisions using the technology to achieve full symbiosis with artificial
        intelligence to achieve what he calls super intelligence and improve the
        human brain function. The Neurallink implant itself has about 3,072
        electrodes in a group of approximately 96 threads. The neurosurgical
        robot that will preform the implant was also created by Musk’s startup
        company(Hitti, 2019). I would like to interject A professor point. I can
        remember a discussion in undergrad and the topic was on technology
        advancement versus our place in the world as humans. We discussed how
        right now technology mainly processes data. We actually talk about that
        point later one but for right now, this particular conversation was
        laying out possible futures for technological advancement. One leading
        theme was that once technology’s data processing capability reaches a
        certain point humanity will transition into technology doing the
        learning we need as it would be to the amount of information that would
        need to be learned would be too great for a standard human life form.
        Consider Elon Musk’s technology, for anyone other then the team who
        invented the technology to do the procedure without it they would first
        have years of college then medical school and then biomedical
        engineering school just to be able to comprehend material to learn the
        technology. We already are blending the lines of technological theory
        and science fiction with reality(Hitti, 2019). Back to the neural link,
        the inserted thread groups are inserted at a in a controlled environment
        at a rate of six threads per minute. The threads themselves each have
        192 electrodes in groups and are smaller than one tenth the diameter of
        the average human hair. The electrode groups are inside a small
        implantable four-millimeter device that has wireless chips. The robot
        would use a 24-micron diameter needle to insert the threads into the
        brain. The goal would be to target various areas of the brain and avoid
        the blood vessels. The patient would also need to first have holes
        drilled into their skull to facilitate the implant. Musk’s and
        Neurallink’s future aspirations are to facilitate the implant by use of
        laser beam piercing tiny holes mimicking the safeness and quickness of
        laser eye surgery. The technology is also presented as being safe and
        painless. It only involves making an incision that is between two and
        eight-millimeters and would require no stiches(Hitti, 2019). One in the
        implant would record information that the brain’s neurons would emit
        through out its network. The brain’s network is created through
        synapses. There are points in the brain where neurons are connected
        through chemical signal communication. The chemical signals are called
        neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are then released based on
        electrical current spikes. The electrical spike the acts as the
        releasing signal is referred to as action potential. Action potential is
        based on a cell receiving enough of/certain levels of specific neural
        transmitters. The message relay happens like a chain reaction that
        produces an electrical field that would then be detected by the
        implanted electrodes. The target hemisphere of the brain can receive up
        to ten implants. Small wires spanning from a conductive coil behind the
        ear would then be tunneled under the scalp to connect the electrodes
        together. An external device referred to only as a link device, is
        comprised of a battery and Bluetooth radio. The would connect to the
        coil under the skin. The link device can be connected to a phone or
        computer via USB. Once connect one can view and record the generated
        data. An app can be used to update the implanted device via Bluetooth as
        well. When the external link device is disconnected the implanted device
        is powered down(Hitti, 2019). According to Hitti, Musk was motivated by
        the 2017 World Government Summit in Dubai’s prediction that in order to
        keep up with A.I. humans have modify their brains(2019). "Over time I
        think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence
        and digital intelligence," said Musk at the conference. "It's mostly
        about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and
        the digital version of yourself, particularly output”. He continued.
        Musk want a future that mitigates the potential threats A.I. posses to
        humanity. He has hope to run human test by the end of 2020, hopefully
        the coronavirus does not stand in the way(Hitti, 2019). Hitti, N. (22,

        (decision support systems) On one level simple integration would not be
        ideal in the long term. In theory if such integrations become mainstream
        the average integrated human would have a collection of devices
        implanted. Very similar to when breast implants became mainstream, it
        was soon followed by individuals have a collection of implants in places
        such as their lips, face, and buttocks. Some have even gone further with
        more injections to mimic a tone muscular physic. However, these implants
        serve more of a cosmetic purpose. In the event of a human machine
        integration revolution these mechanical and computing implants would
        server a functional purpose. However, the average human would need to
        not have to have conscious control over the devices implanted in their
        body. To highlight this lets take a look at the human anatomy and the
        requirements of its functions. -> this section will be brief if it makes
        it to thesis but for the book this will be a significant section
        probably its own chapter. The purpose is to chow the need for decision
        support systems based on the bodies conscious and unconscious functions
        (Brain anotomy) The brain was touch on earlier during the discussion on
        the Neural link technology. The brain is so important to the body that
        while talk about transplants and implants happens, the idea of replacing
        the brain does not exist more so compliment or evolve the brain. It is
        considered one of the most complex organs in the body. The largest
        region of the brain is called the cerebral cortex and what most see when
        looking at the brain. It is divided into sections or lobes; frontal,
        parietal, occipital, and temporal. As it sounds the frontal lobe deals
        with reasoning, motor skills, high level cognition and expressive
        language and as it sounds is located at the front of the brain. The
        parietal lobe is found in the brain’s middle section and deals with
        tactile sensory (pressure, touch pain, etc). The temporal lobe is found
        in the brain’s bottom section and deals with auditory interpretation and
        memory. The occipital lobe deals with the interpretation of visual
        stimuli and is located in the back portion of the brain(Cherry, 2019).
        After the cortex the next part of the brain is the brain stem made up of
        the midbrain, pons, and medulla. The midbrain is actually the smallest
        brain region. This part of the brain relays auditory and visual
        information. The midbrain has a section the also deals with the body’s
        control of movement. The medulla lies right above the spinal cord on the
        lower brain stem. The medulla deals with autonomic functions; heart
        rate, breathing, and blood pressure. Pons are what connects the medulla,
        cerebral cortex, and cerebellum together. It also helps stimulate
        breathing and the body’s control of sleep cycles(Cherry, 2019). The next
        part of the brain is the cerebellum. It lies on top of the pons and
        behind the brain stem. The cerebellum receives information from the
        ear’s balance system, sensory nerves, auditory systems, and visual
        systems. It takes this information and uses it to coordinate movements
        so that they are smooth. The next part of the brain is the thalamus
        which transmits movement and sensory information to the cerebral cortex
        and other systems. The next section is the hypothalamus which lies at
        the brain’s base. This section deals with hunger, thirst, emotions,
        temperature regulation, and circadian rhythms. It also controls the
        pituitary gland which secrets the body’s hormones. Those are the main
        sections of the brain(Cherry, 2019). Cherry, K. (17, July 2019) A Guide
        to the Anatomy of the Brain. Retrieved from:
        https://www.verywellmind.com/the-anatomy-of-the-brain-2794895 Why does
        this matter? If notice the brain deals with a large portion of sensory
        and movement functions of the body on top of many other functions. Those
        functions are what a lot of the research on organ transplants and
        artificial implants looks to compliment. These functions or not
        functions that the conscious human brain controls. For example, humans
        do not conscious make sure the auditory information they received are
        relayed to the appropriate parts of the brain. Even if a person wants to
        there is no way from that person to let’s say make sure the occipital
        lobe is doing what it is supposed to without the outside observation of
        a physician. Many of these functions would need a decision support
        system to help mimic and protect the autonomy of these devices
        especially when multiple are implanted in the body and must work
        together to provide a smooth human body experience the way the brain and
        organs natural work together for the same experience. The following is
        source material to be summarize this week focusing on editing but this
        material once summarize will make it to the final copy. Still thinking
        of if this is stay I know how it ties in but I have not wrote the setup
        for it and not sure where to put it may have to be for book not thesis.
        It is to show the natural nature of connect with biology not born with
        but help the main organism function like adding an artificial organ. The
        Portuguese man o’ war, (Physalia physalis) is often called a jellyfish,
        but is actually a species of siphonophore, a group of animals that are
        closely related to jellyfish. A siphonophore is unusual in that it is
        comprised of a colony of specialized, genetically identical individuals
        called zooids — clones — with various forms and functions, all working
        together as one. Each of the four specialized parts of a man o’ war is
        responsible for a specific task, such as floating, capturing prey,
        feeding, and reproduction. Found mostly in tropical and subtropical
        seas, men o' war are propelled by winds and ocean currents alone, and
        sometimes float in legions of 1,000 or more! Resembling an 18th-century
        Portuguese warship under full sail, the man o’ war is recognized by its
        balloon-like float, which may be blue, violet, or pink and rises up to
        six inches above the waterline. Lurking below the float are long strands
        of tentacles and polyps that grow to an average of 30 feet and may
        extend by as much as 100 feet. The tentacles contain stinging
        nematocysts, microscopic capsules loaded with coiled, barbed tubes that
        deliver venom capable of paralyzing and killing small fish and
        crustaceans. While the man o’ war’s sting is rarely deadly to people, it
        packs a painful punch and causes welts on exposed skin. Beachcombers be
        warned: The stalwart man o’ war may still sting you even weeks after
        having washed ashore. Last updated: 06/25/18 Author: NOAA

        Support Systems) How would all this work, considering the brain and the
        role it plays in the body how would this all need to work in order for
        the human body experience to continue to be smooth combination of many
        different functions? A decision support system is a software program
        designed to help the user make decisions or help decide on a course of
        action. Found most commonly in organizational or business settings,
        decision support systems are applied to information such as, revenue,
        sales, and other operational data. The data gets gathered and analyzed
        by the system. The systems then presents that information in the form of
        comprehensive reports. The user uses these reports to decisions. The
        information must be presented in a way that is easily understandable by
        the user, the information must be beneficial, and it must be easily
        accessible for the user while remaining secure (Segal, 2019). Segal, T.

        Decision support systems have also been applied to the medical field in
        what is known as clinical decision support systems. In the medical
        field, clinical decision support systems provides target information for
        a specific patient that can be used by members of that patient’s medical
        care team. The purpose is for the care team to be more efficient while
        also avoiding errors. These systems vary widely from simple alerts, to
        diagnostic support. These systems have quickly become essential tools in
        hospitals with many being integrated in to electronic health system
        record systems (Bresnick, n.d.). Bresnick, J. (n.d.) Understanding the
        Basics of Clinical Decision Support Systems. Retrieved from:
        https://healthitanalytics.com/features/understanding-the-basics-of-clinical-decision-support-systems
        Now consider decision support systems, how they work now, and how they
        could possibly work in the future. Consider how such systems already
        contribute to medical industry. Access to this real time and archive
        data is what I find very attractive. How much easier would it be for a
        doctor to diagnosed a client he his body was fitted with technology to
        run blood test in real time without the use of a lab. How much more
        successful would a soldier be if he could filter out the sounds of large
        explosions over the sounds of human voice commands. How much easier
        would it be for the public to be aware of a crisis if they had access to
        that data in real time without needing to power on a device separate
        from their body. Also consider this technology from the standpoint of
        human computer integration. This system could help multiple movement
        complementary devices and implanted devices work together in the body
        while allowing the user/wearer to conduct their daily life functions and
        maybe even enhance it. In the this even such a system would be necessary
        as a lot of functions the system would complement would part of the
        body’s natural unconscious functions. While there with need to be some
        centralized functionality to relay information from implants, organs,
        and bodily functions to make these functions smooth like a decision
        support system. There would need to be functionality that allowed for
        connectivity with devices outside of the body. The neural link
        technology produced by the Elon Musk requires connectivity with a link
        device. The average pace maker has some connectivity with an external
        device to read the data. The RFID chip technology includes some form of
        external connectivity as well. Well external connectivity is something
        that would be both be a benefit and a necessity in some regards for the
        continuation of human/machine/computer integration, it also brings up
        another issue, security. With the increase in internet connected devices
        and technological innovations that one issue that has continually risen
        up to meets these advancements is cyber crime. Cyber is generally
        defined as a crime that used either internet or computing technology to
        commit a crime. Examples can be fraud, data theft, denial of service,
        and the list just goes on. The 2018 statistics on cyber crime is note
        worthy to say the least. In 2018 it was reported the 2017 saw 780,000
        records lost per day. Healthcare industry saw increases in ransomware
        attacks. 2017 saw thirty percent of phishing emails sent in the US were
        opened. That same year over 2.53 million UAE citizens were victims of
        some form of cyber crime. Personal data began to be sold for $.20.
        Another startling realization was the increase use of encryption with
        cyber criminals that resulted in the average data breach taking
        approximately 6 months to be found (Foster,2020). Foster, J. (2020) 21

        Cybercrime is here to stay and will continue to evolve and increase as
        technological innovations also evolve and increase. This is why security
        considerations must be made especially considering some of the
        connectivity requirements that will exist. Not only that reason but
        remember the different functions of the body that act as form of
        security; skin, eyelids, immune system, etc. In this situation, the
        devices potential implanted would function in the form of a network.
        Just like the brain and bodily functions work in a network. Security
        could be mimicked or parallels could be found by examining some of the
        best practices from network security; access control,
        cryptography/encryptions, intrusion detection, and intrusion prevention.
        Access control in short is making sure only authorized persons or
        devices can access the implanted devices and the data the they produce.
        Medical data falls under HIPPA and on one level this could be considered
        medical data. On the other hand it must be considered that data on
        people is sold for profit, when someone sends their DNA for an ancestry
        link their DNA is now owned by that company in the U.S. Laws may change
        but reality alone is that this data would be a lucrative commodity. The
        encryption aspect is with this data as commodity idea in mind. Just like
        financial data is stolen in transit this type of data would also be a
        target for cyber criminals. Encryptions is another layer of security
        that ensures that if data is stolen it cannot be read. Encryptions are
        based on the cryptography concept of being computationally infeasible.
        Meaning cracking the encryption would take skills, resources, and time
        past what is considered feasible to break. The intrusion prevention on
        another layer would work to further block complex attempts to access
        devices or steal their information. This system would work hand in hand
        with intrusion detection system to detect would attempts are made to
        harden the network against future similar attacks. (Are We Already
        There) Corey Powell, in his NBC article entitled” Cyborgs will replace
        humans and remake the world…”, provides a look into his prediction of a
        dominant human cyborg population. His starting premise is that the rise
        of intelligent machines are what will bring this prediction into
        reality(Powell, 2019). While this doom and gloom view held by people
        like Elon Musk and the vast majority of people who watch the Terminator
        series and remembering that we are beginning the age in which companies
        are interlacing technology with housing constructions called smart homes
        and it is only a matter time be form that next step is taken. Returning
        to Powell, he leans heavily on exerts from British author James
        Lovelock. Lovelock believes that future will not be understood by the
        current human population but rather by a rising cyborg population that
        will be able to actively build and maintain their bodies through the use
        of technology. Sounds very similar to Elon Musk’s prediction that the
        human brain would need to be modified to keep up with A.I.. Powell and
        Lovelock believe that hese human machine hybrids would be self-aware and
        self-sufficient bringing about what he calls the new age of Novacene or
        the age of hyper intelligence. One stark detail of Lovelocks prediction
        that Powell draws attention to is that he does not think or intelligent
        machines would not turn against us.(Powell, 2019). I personally share
        this view. I head the pleasure of interning under Dr. Desiree Depriest
        PHD who holds degrees and both Clinical Psychology and Information
        technology. One quote of hers that stands out to me is, “A.I. is only as
        smart as the human creating it… the only task A.I. can do faster or
        better a human currently is data processing.” Having obtained degrees in
        I.T. myself I find this to be sound logic. It is my opinion that for a
        wide ranging A.I. assault or revolution like in the terminator to take
        place there would need to be human intervention every step of the way.
        Humans would have to design algorithms that would make this possible.
        More logically however, is the idea that A.I. and machine technology
        will become integrated with human biology and aid in our micro
        evolutionary processes. Lovelock has written of his imaginings of a
        world where human machine hybrids of populated every corner of the earth
        creating a new hierarchy in the kingdom life (Powell, 2019). I am one
        who personally holds the belief that if humans by means of machine
        integration could lower their biological energy needs we would also
        significantly lower the human biological footprint. This would in turn
        lower of biological consumption rates and lower the energy humans would
        both require and use. This could potential lead to the lower of climate
        crisis like climate and could give humans more time to deal with the
        over population crisis. Returning to Powell, he believes the first
        stages of Novacene are already upon us. He points to instances of
        machine learning as examples. One such example is the AlpaZero computer
        program that was taught how to play a Chinese strategy game far more
        complex then chess called Go. The program is now the worlds best go
        player (Powell, 2019). I personally think is a relevant to point out the
        all the program is really doing is process data and dynamic
        probabilities at a very fast rate. This increase data processing makes
        it ideal in a strategy game based on a limited possibility of move
        combinations for success. Powell continues to state Lovelock’s opinion
        from his writings. Lovelock believes that humans cannot truly imagine
        what cyborgs will look like because of the fact that it has not happened
        yet. The concept would require the rethinking some of the most widely
        accepted biological and other scientific assumptions about the
        world/universe. He also believe that this rethinking would change human
        understanding of the planet, the things in/on it, and how these things
        interact with one another. Lovelock believes that true cyborgs would
        have the potentail evolve pass our understanding and intellect. He also
        believed that they would be the new dominate species. He calls on
        society to consider how current computers or machines like the Mar’s
        rover take base elements to create new parts for themselves and carry
        that thought process over to humans. He uses this idea to hypothesize
        that a new species one that humans did not intend to create would also
        be birthed based on the natural evolution A.I. precursor that humans
        would create. This logic would contradict the earlier statement by Dr.
        DePriest that A.I. is only as smart as the humans creating it. It is
        however logical prediction as life creates on its own rules. In
        lovelock’s mind, these new intelligent species could help the earth
        combat climate change as they still would be bound by the need to
        preserve the planet and its climate for survival. He also believes that
        these hybrids could aid us in our search for extraterrestrial life. I
        would like to draw contrast in my opinions. Would such a feat happen
        overnight? No, nothing does. It would not happen over a sort of amount
        of years either. Each scientific breakthrough/innovation was first
        preluded by years of test with many feats coming by accident followed by
        an even longer period of study of the real time effects of the break
        through. I do however believe that if we are not driving this change the
        change would be driven without us even in the car. Powell, C. (25,
        August 2019) Cyborgs will replace humans and remake the world, James
        Lovelock says. Retrieved from:

        Say Lovelock is right and his predictions came true what would be next?
        What is life? What defines Human existence? How do humans standalone
        separate and different from our environment? What makes us human? Is
        there one particular characteristic that is undoubtably human? Did we
        evolve from a common ape ancestor? Did an omnipotent being will us into
        existence? Roughly 96 percent of the mass of the average human body is
        made up of just four elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen,
        with a lot of that mass in the form of water. The remaining four percent
        is a sparse sampling of the periodic table of elements (Schirber, 2009).

        about Mars Rover Can AI foot the bill Speaking of scary Terminator level
        things, a few years back Facebook had to abruptly shut down one of it’s
        A.I. engines. The cause was due to a discovering of a completely new and
        unique language created by the AI engine. The engine had created this
        new language completely void of human input. The discovery was made when
        chatbots started to communicate in this language. This calls into
        question the potential of a truly sentient A.I. not being possible. Many
        people have long feared moments like this. Many would say this as the
        moment mankind would experience irreversible change. Tech scientist like
        Bill Gates and Elon Musk are often giving hypothesis of the doom and
        gloom of humanity with A.I. being the fall of the human race. The
        mainstream argument is that human bound by our current biological
        development could not keep up with a species that could make changes
        both genetic and biological that it deemed necessary in real time.
        Hollywood has done a good job of adding to the skepticism with movies
        like Terminator and iRobot. There is the off chance that A.I. would deem
        us as a threat and could systematically eliminate us in a fashion so
        advance and fast we could not see it coming. Add section on Sophia robot
        * may not make it to thesisThis due to the nature of processing large
        amounts of data that would take significantly longer for any human to
        achieve. This same processing ability that can lead to humanity’s down
        fall is the same ability that makes A.I. so attractive at aiding our
        everyday lives. Tom Bradley proposes we pull the plug on machine
        learning and retreat back to a simpler way of life. However, consider
        how true Elon Musk’s view that the brain needs to be modified to keep up
        and mitigate potential A.I. threats. I believe this event at Facebook is
        evidence the truth of his prediction and why further research and
        innovation is not only warranted but necessary (Bradley, 2017). Bradley,

        Preview Of Our Potential Future. Retrieved from:

        I would like to refer back to a quote by a former mentor of mine Dr.
        Depriest, “AI is only as smart as the human making it.” This directly
        contradicts the opinion of some of the great minds of technological
        science. However, there is something there. It would be negligent to
        have created something that the creator cannot actually control. No
        innovator can guarantee that humans can continue to design machines that
        learn on their own and also stay ahead of potential future A.I. learning
        in the design process alone. The Facebook example is a prime example of
        this but with human interjection the research was able to regain
        control. What I find fault in would this automatically lead to our
        undoing. I mean we do not see the Mar’s rover trying to create ships to
        return and attack earth. I do believe that human AI integration should
        be limited. For example, it would be a nightmare for a machine
        integrated with the human body to suddenly override the human’s
        consciousness or movements. However, I believe the quote from my mentor
        Dr. DePriest still stands. Humans must first think of the complexity in
        order to design the complexity. With that being said there obviously are
        things they we still need to be figured out in order to make this idea a
        reality. One of the bigger things that need to happen is the mapping of
        the human consciousness similarly as was done with the human genome
        project. There has been some research conducted using primates with the
        hope of discovering what it is that makes us alive. The test subjects
        where macaque monkeys. They had a percentage of macaques a sleep,
        another percentage awake, and others under the influence of different
        anesthesia. They placed electrodes across their brains. The result of
        the experiment lead scientist to find two pathways in their brains that
        related to consciousness and a region that energizes these pathways. The
        area of the brain that powers the paths is called the lateral thalamus.
        Redinbaugh, who lead the project once it to be clear that the team in no
        way has mapped the consciousness as in their opinion consciousness is
        expresses through activity that encompasses the entire brain. They just
        have a better understanding of the process. The describe consciousness
        as being awake in conjunction with the responsiveness to stimuli. The
        project sought to answer the question of what makes people conscious
        (Letzter, 2020)? Rafi Letzer 2/18/2020

        Conclusion start *What would it mean to be human without or less of the
        human body Return to the elemental makeup of the human body in the
        introduction section. Would those elements in the average human
        percentages would you say that is an appropriate image of you? What
        would that be? I think of some of the greatest medical feats like organ
        and skin transplants. Consider an unfortunate victim, maybe a burn
        victim, explosive ordinance, or other large facial trauma. Are they
        their trauma? Consider facial transplant is what on their face a
        distinct of who they are inside as a person. I would like to again throw
        into consideration a personal hero of mine Stephen Hawking I mean no
        disrespect but am attempting a true constructive exploration of some
        realities. Imagine the tragedy of Hawking being born 1000 year prior.
        Would humans have been able to reap the benefits of his genius? How many
        other people of similar condition has society discounted or failed at
        producing a fair environment for them to bless the collective with their
        genius and intellect? Are they too doomed to be defined be their
        biological constraints? I mention Hawking because of the extremity of
        his genius. Think again about how so much of the little control he
        physically had in his life was centered around an intelligent machine
        that sensed movements on his cheek and translating it to speech and
        chair movement. Imagine if he could have had suit that could stimulation
        his spinal signals and facilitate movement. Going even further, could he
        have not been further integrated and possible able to experience some
        form of free movement. Moving past Mr. Hawking, how many more others
        could have life saving or changing futures due to the potentials of
        humans machine/computer integration? Many lives would be changed for the
        better. The amount of data produced would help birth research in areas
        previously thought unreachable. A new world would be produced that likes
        of which would revival some of the previous innovations such as the
        light bulbs. The science is already within the reaches of humanity. The
        research in the last 20 years that has taken places in metaphorical
        vacuums are smaller pieces of a potentially larger puzzles. With the hep
        of machines and computing devices humans can take a step forward for a
        healthier future.
